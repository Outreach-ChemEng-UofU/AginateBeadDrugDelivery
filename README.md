# Alginate Bead, Drug Delivery
Alginate beads are a hydrogel bead with a liquid center. They can be used as a drug delivery model, by loading them with a dye that diffuses out over time. This module focuses on both product and process engineering, two staples of chemical engineering. A system for the automated production of these beads is designed and created by students, and bead geometries and mass transfer properties are then analyzed.
